            <p> 
                My name is Moinul, with my nickname from many of colleges being Manny.
                I have been intrigued by Web Development and other specification in Full Stack Development. Many of my hobbies consist of photography, game development having experience in C# and experience in the field of photography through the Podcast 101 program given by the Brooklyn STEAM Center, learning the technical aspect of the field. In addition, to collaboration to more diverse fileds outside of my own, I still dwell and rome to find the path that I will hopefully enjoy in the future and all the people I have to meet in the future in my potential endeavors.
